> WHAT: Every organization on the planet knows WHAT they do. There are the
> products they sell, or the services they offer.

> HOW: Some organizations know HOW they do it. These are the things that make
> them special or set them apart from their competition.

> WHY: Very few organizations know WHY they do what they do. WHY is not about
> making money. That's a result. WHY is a purpose, cause or belief. It's the
> very reason your organization exists.

> WHY is just a belief (values), HOWs are the actions we take to realize that
> belief, and WHATs are the results of those actions.
