> WHAT: Every organization on the planet knows WHAT they do. There are the
> products they sell, or the services they offer.

> HOW: Some organizations know HOW they do it. These are the things that make
> them special or set them apart from their competition.

> WHY: Very few organizations know WHY they do what they do. WHY is not about
> making money. That's a result. WHY is a purpose, cause or belief. It's the
> very reason your organization exists.

> WHY is just a belief (values), HOWs are the actions we take to realize that
> belief, and WHATs are the results of those actions.

> People don't buy what you do. People buy why you do it.

> The School Bus Test is a metaphor that asks, "If a founder or leader of an
> organization were to be hit by a school bus, would the organization continue
> to thrive at the same pace without them at the helm?" So many companies are
> built on the force of a single personality, that if the leader or founder is
> gone the company can be highly disrupted and even falter. The question is,
> when the leader or founder departures, how well-prepared is an organization to
> find effective ways to keep the founding vision alive indefinitely?
