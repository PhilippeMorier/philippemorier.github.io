> Think of RxJS as Lodash for events.

1. Lodash works on array, which aren't functions.
2. Better comparison would be the `IEnumerable` type in C#. They are factories for iterator. I.e. you can always go back
and re-enumarate over them.
3. In lodash, if you use a `map` and a `filter` you create for each of them a new array. In Rx we are passing events/values
from one operator to the next since it is a pipeline.

ReactiveX combines the Observer pattern with the Iterator pattern and functional programming with collections to fill
the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.

# [Observable](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable)

Observables are lazy Push collections of multiple values. An Observable is a lazily evaluated computation that can
synchronously or asynchronously return zero to (potentially) infinite values from the time it's invoked onwards.

|        | SINGLE     | MULTIPLE     |
| ------ |----------- | ------------ |
| *Pull* | `Function` | `Iterator`   |
| *Push* | `Promise`  | `Observable` |

|        | PRODUCER   | CONSUMER     |
| ------ |----------- | ------------ |
| *Pull* | *Passive:* produces data when requested. | *Active:* decides when data is requested. |
| *Push* | *Active:* produces data at its own pace. | *Passive:* reacts to received data. |

> Observables are like functions with zero arguments, but generalize those to allow multiple values.
> I.e. Observables can "return" multiple values over time (with multiple `subscriber.next(value)`).

> Subscribing to an Observable is analogous to calling a Function.
> Each call to `observable.subscribe()` triggers its own independent setup for that given subscriber.

> Observables are able to deliver values either synchronously or asynchronously.


> In an Observable Execution, zero to infinite Next notifications may be delivered. If either an Error or Complete
> notification is delivered, then nothing else can be delivered afterwards.

> When you subscribe, you get back a Subscription, which represents the ongoing execution. Just call unsubscribe()
> to cancel the execution.

An 'raw/naked' Observable without ReactiveX types would result in  rather straightforward JavaScript.

```JavaScript
function subscribe(subscriber) {
  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    subscriber.next('hi');
  }, 1000);

  return function unsubscribe() {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  };
}

const unsubscribe = subscribe({next: (x) => console.log(x)});

// Later:
unsubscribe(); // dispose the resources
```

The reason why we use Rx types like Observable, Observer, and Subscription is to get safety (such as the Observable
 Contract) and composability with Operators.
 
# Operators

## Transformation Operators

### exhaustMap

Drag & drop, first subscribe needs to finish until I subscribe to next, we don't want that a second touch event e.g.
with second finger cancels current subscription. You don't care about latest.

### switchMap

Autocomplete, we just care about the result of the last value, therefore we unsubscribe from current observable when
new value and subscribe to new observable

### concatMap

Do one after the other, you care about response and their order

### mergeMap

You care about response but not about their order

## Error Handling

* `catchError()`
* `retry()` 
* `retryWhen()`
