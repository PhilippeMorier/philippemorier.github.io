title: OpenVDB
definition:
  Hierarchical data structure and a large suite of tools for the efficient
  storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data.
tags: dynamic sparse volumetric data tree tile voxel grid

*V*olumetric,  
*D*ynamic grid that shares several characteristics with  
_B_+trees

### Characteristics

- Dynamic
- Memory efficient
- General topology
- Fast random and sequential data access
- Virtually infinite
- Efficient hierarchical algorithms
- Adaptive resolution
- Simplicity
- Configurable
- Out-of-core

## Buildings Blocks

- Direct access bit masks: provide fast and compact direct access to a binary
  representation of the topology
  - hierarchical topology encoding
  - fast sequential iterators
  - lossless compression
  - boolean operations
  - efficient implementations of algorithms
- Leaf nodes
  - keep the size of the LeafNodes relatively small for two reasons:
    - cache performance and
    - memory overhead from partially filled LeafNodes with few active voxels
- Internal nodes
- Root node
  - sparse and can be dynamically resized (via hash-map)
  - bottom-up vs. top-down tree traversals via `Accessors` due to spatially
    coherent grid access
  - `Accessor` are used to amortize the overhead of slow lookup into the
    `mRootTable` (hash-map) by means of reusing cached child nodes.

## Access Algorithms

- Random Access
- Sequential Access
- [Stencil Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_code)

### [Boost](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51924884/3731530)

Check
[recommended version](https://www.openvdb.org/documentation/doxygen/dependencies.html#depDependencyTable).

```bash
# go to home folder
cd
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.61.0/boost_1_54_0.tar.gz
tar -zxvf boost_1_61_0.tar.gz
cd boost_1_61_0

./bootstrap.sh

# get the no of cpucores to make faster
cpuCores=`cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "cpu cores" | uniq | awk '{print $NF}'`
echo "Available CPU cores: "$cpuCores
sudo ./b2 --with=all -j $cpuCores install
```
