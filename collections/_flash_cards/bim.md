The BIM-method supports the collaboration between all stakeholders over the
whole life-cycle (from planing, building to maintenance) of a building. The
collaboration is supported by digital construction models which are enriched
with parameters. BIM makes these models easy to access, easy to exchange, share
and validate against defined rules and models from other disciplines (e.g.
architect, structural, plumbing, electrical engineer). Therefore, BIM promotes
collaboration through a transparent communication, supports (cross-disciplinary)
model quality checks/verifications and helps with decisions for further planing.

The digital models connect geometrical information (e.g. shape, position, area,
volumes, etc.) with none-geometrical information (e.g. material, color, etc.).

- _Discipline Specific Model_: architectural, structural, geographical
- _Coordination Model_: combination of discipline specific models for error
  detection
- _Reference Model_: e.g. architectural or BIM Inventory Model
- _Presentation Model_: for visualisation/presentation

## Open BIM

### [buildingSMART](https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/)

#### IFC

Industry Foundation Classes is an open and international standard for exchanging
digital models (\*.ifc, \*.ifcxml, \*.ifczip) according to SN EN ISO 16739.

#### BCF

Open standard for exchanging change requests (\*.bcf).

## Model Checking
