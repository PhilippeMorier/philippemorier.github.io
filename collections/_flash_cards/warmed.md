- **Write** the code
- **Agree** on code if there are more than one person involved
- **Read** the code
- **Modify** the code
- **Execute** the code on hardware
- **Debug** the code

These are things developers actually do. They are costs. E.g. how much does the
execution cost? How much time does it need on the customer's computer to run?
Besides, "execution", the other costs are developer time which affects the
customer. Therefore, we try to minify as most of the costs as possible.
